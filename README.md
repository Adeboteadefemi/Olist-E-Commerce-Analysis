Delivery Efficiency: A major hurdle is identified with 59.37% (29.65K) of all orders classified as Late Deliveries.

Performance Gap: Only a small fraction, 5.04% (2.52K), achieve Rapid Delivery status.

Time Distribution: Most orders peak in the 10 to 20-day delivery window.

Outlier Delays: Distribution tails indicate some orders take 40+ days to reach the customer.

Distance vs. Cost: Scatter plots show a high density of Freight Values below $100.

Weight Correlation: Most products are under 10,000 grams; freight outliers increase as weight hits 30,000+ grams.

Logistical Bottleneck: The nearly 60% late delivery rate suggests systemic last-mile fulfillment issues.
